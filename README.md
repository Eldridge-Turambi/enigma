# Enigma

## project by Eldridge Turambi

### Self Assessment

#### FUNCTIONALITY = 3
##### MEETS EXPECTATIONS: My encrypt and decrypt methods do work and according to the tests and both the Encrypt/Decrypt Command Line Interfaces are successfully implemented


#### OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING = 2
##### BELOW EXPECTATIONS: I can clearly identify the responsibility of each class that they created and the methods that they wrote. I am able to describe why I have organized my code in the way that I did. However my encrypt and decrypt methods are long and break single responsibility. All other methods however do not break single responsibility principle. I think I might have too little classes for this project but for the most part, it includes little knowledge/information/behavior that is necessary for a given class to know and has little things that it does not need to know(I can explain this better during project eval :)

#### RUBY CONVENTIONS AND MECHANICS = 3
##### MEETS EXPECTATIONS: I believe my code to be properly indented and spaced. I do not believe my lines are excessively long. Is not perfect but it looks good :) All my enumerables are the mosts efficient tool for what I need to do and I feel fairly confident I speak to that during project evals. Hashes are implemented in both my encrypt and decrypt method

#### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT = 3
##### MEETS EXPECTATIONS: All methods have passing tests that cover both the unit and integration level. Edge cases that were noted in the instruction for this project were accounted for in tests. My commit history shows that I write the tetsts before completing the code. SimpleCov metrics show coverage to be 100%

#### VERSION CONTROL = true

##### 30+ commits were made and uses a pull request workflow that includes related and logical functionality(check branch names and pull request history).

### AVERAGE SCORE
#### 2.75!

#### My Predicted Outcome: PASS :) I hope

**fingers crossed**
